Welcome to ChromBERT-tools Documentation!
==========================================

**ChromBERT** is a pre-trained deep learning model designed to capture genome-wide co-association patterns of ~1,000 transcription regulators and to learn context-specific transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs).

**ChromBERT-tools** is a lightweight toolkit that exposes core ChromBERT functionality through easy-to-use command-line tools (CLI).

Features
--------

* **Easy-to-use CLI**: Simple command-line interface for common ChromBERT tasks
* **Flexible**: Works with hg38 (human) and mm10 (mouse) genomes, and different resolutions
* **Comprehensive**: Tools for embedding, imputation, inference, and driver factor analysis
* **Cell-specific**: Support for cell-type specific analysis

Quick Start
-----------

Check out the :doc:`installation` section for setup instructions, and the :doc:`usage` section to learn how to use ChromBERT-tools.
